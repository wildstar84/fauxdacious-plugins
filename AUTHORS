HISTORY

Fauxdacious is a fork of Audacious, by Jim Turner, starting at Audacious vsn. 3.6
which adds several features to Audacious that the Audacious team refuses to
implement: 

* A "DVD-player" plugin for playing DVDs (video, audio & menus)!
* A "visualization" option for displaying the video of ffmpeg files 
and streams that contain both an audio and a video stream!
* User-customizable URL-preprocessing script option (Youtube.com, iheart.com, 
et. al. url-handling already included).  Users can add more!
(Included script Requires Perl, but user can choose own scripting language).
* User-savable metadata for streams, and media codecs that don't support it.
* Restoration of XMMS "preset" equalization button for song-specific, 
directory-specific, and cuesheet-specific equalization.
* Option to save active Effects plugin list with custom equalizer presets for 
song/stream/disk/directory-specific Effects setup.
* Option to divert audio output to stdout in the user's choice of selected audio 
formats for further processing by another program.
* Piping through stdin input for playlists as well as most media formats.
* Option to use the Pause button to simply mute (ie. commercials) while stream 
continues to play, allowing you to listen to something else in another instance 
(see next feature).
* Multiple named instances with command-line option to specify alternate 
configurations and fauxdtool instances.
* Option to fetch and store cover-art for CDs and DVDs (requires Perl).
* Additional command-line options!
* Most new Audacious features / fixes merged in in a timely manner!
* Cool new name, logo and skins! :D

The Fauxdacious logo was designed by (c 2015) Jim Turner.  All Fauxdacious changes 
and patches, including plugin changes are copyright (c 2015) by Jim Turner,  with 
all rights reserved.  You are free to use Fauxdacious subject to the same license 
and terms as Audacious itself.  Your contributions are welcome!  We wish to be a true 
community project.  If you have a (reasonable and sane) idea (AND a patch that works) 
and the Audacious team rejects it (likely), feel free to submit it and I will
(try to) work with you to get it included!  At Fauxdacious, we do not have a 
“not invented here“ attitude!

Audacious was originally based on the X Multimedia System (“XMMS”) via its
GTK+ 2.x port Beep Media Player (“BMP”).  Audacious has changed quite a bit
since its first release, however, and little XMMS/BMP code remains.

The Audacious project began in 2005 under the leadership of William Pitcock
(“nenolod”).  Many people have made contributions, both large and small, since
that time.  At present, the project is led by John Lindgren and Michał Lipski
(“tallica”), with help from a few others.  Special thanks go to Michał Lipski
for setting up and maintaining the current website, and to Thomas Lange for
leading the translation effort.

The Audacious logo was designed by George Averill and updated by John Lindgren.
It uses the “Circulate” font created by Brian Kent.

Besides the developers listed below, a word of thanks is also due to the many
people who have helped to translate the Audacious interface into a number of
different (human) languages.  The translation effort is now done mostly through
Transifex, making it easier to contribute but also nearly impossible to
maintain a list of those who have done so.
